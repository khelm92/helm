                <article id="columns">
                        <p>The domestic dog <em>(Canis lupus familiaris)</em> is a subspecies of the gray wolf <em>(Canis lupus)</em>, a member of the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora.
                        The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The dog has been the first animal to be domesticated and has been the most
                        widely kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human history.</p>
                        
                        <p>DNA evidence shows an evolutionary split between the modern dog's lineage and the modern wolf's lineage around 100,000 years ago but the oldest archeological
                        specimens which is genetically linked to the modern dog's lineage date to 33,000 years ago. Dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming
                        ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship,
                        and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname "Man's Best Friend" in the Western world. In some cultures,
                        dogs are also a source of meat. In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles.
                        Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.
                        For example, height measured to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from
                        white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or
                        long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.</p>
