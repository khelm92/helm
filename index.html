                <article id= "columns">
                        <p>The domestic cat (Felis catus or Felis silvestris catus) is a small, usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal. It is often called the housecat when
                        kept as an indoor pet, or simply the cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines.
                        Cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin and household pests.</p>
                        
                        <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey.
                        Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small game.
                        They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.</p>
                        
                        <p>There are about 40 different breeds of cats, and they are the most popular pet in America with over 30% of households owning a cat. Not all countries have the same love
                        for cats though <em>(at least as pets)</em>, over 4 millions cats are eaten each year in Asian countries. The earliest known domesticated pet cat was found buried with it's owner
                        in a 9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.</p>
