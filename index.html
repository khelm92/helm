                    <p>There are about 40 different breeds of cats, and they are the most popular pet in America with over 30% of households owning a cat. Not all countries have the same love
                    for cats though <em>(at least as pets)</em>, over 4 millions cats are eaten each year in Asian countries. The earliest known domesticated pet cat was found buried with it's owner
                    in a 9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.</p>
